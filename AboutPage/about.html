    <p>Karma is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" web game that takes the user through a normal day in the life as a high school student.
        However, the choices you make have consequences, just like they do in real life. The different choices you make influence what
        your path will be for the rest of the game, but you also get a glimpse at how your future could change drastically just because
        of a single good or bad decision. This is called the "butterfly effect," which is why the logo of the website is a butterfly.

  <p>Whether you believe in the idea of karma or not, we've always been told to treat people the way we want to be treated,
    which is what this game aims to teach. Sometimes we forget how impactful our decisions can be, and this short story shows
    how much of an effect we have on our futures and those of the people we interact with.
