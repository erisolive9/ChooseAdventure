    <h2>Karma - A "Choose Your Own Adventure" Game</h2>
    <p>Karma is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" web game that takes the user through a normal day in the life as a high school student.
        However, the choices you make have consequences, just like they do in real life. The different choices you make influence what
        your path will be for the rest of the game, but you also get a glimpse at how your future could change drastically just because
        of a single good or bad decision. This is called the "butterfly effect," which is why the logo of the website is a butterfly.
